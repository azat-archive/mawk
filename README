This is mawk 1.0
an interpreter for the AWK programming language as
defined in the 1988 AWK book, i.e. a new awk.

If you use old awk, you should definitely switch to a new awk
as the language is much more versatile.

Mawk is generally faster than other new (or old) awks.

Mawk also allows the record separator (RS) to be a regular
expression which makes non-line oriented text processing
tasks easier. (See the man pages for examples and section
THE AWK LANGUAGE.11 for the exact record splitting algorithm).


Target OS is all flavors of UNIX and MsDOS
	compiled and tested on:

	sun3, SunOS4.0.3
	sun4, SunOS4.0.3[c]  , SunOS4.1
	BSD43 VAX
	SysVR3 on Stardent3000
	Ultrix4.1 on MicroVax3600
	Ultrix4.1 on mips  decstation
	Ultrix4.2 on mips  decstation
	Ultrix3.1 on vax
	XENIX SysV R2.3.1
	SCO Unix sysVR3.2v2.0
	ESIX System 5.3.2 RevD using gcc 1.39
	Dynix on Sequent Symmetry

	MsDOS TurboC++1.0, small and large model
	      MSC 6.0A
		(system() and pipes are missing from DOS mawk)

This version of mawk is compatible with the AWK book and
sysVR3 nawk.  It lacks a few features of sysVR4 nawk which
have been incorporated into the posix 11.1 draft for awk.
Differences between new awks are discussed in the 
COMPATIBILITY ISSUES section of the man pages.
