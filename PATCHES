patch1:  mawk1.1 to mawk1.1.1

1) fixed bug which caused 

	mawk 'program'  var=value

without files on the command line to sporadically fail.

2) fixed bug which caused

	getline <=

to be mistaken for input redirection.

3) Changed rexp1.c to work around a bug in sun SC1.0 compiler.

4) Minor improvements to build_mawk script.

5) changed the name of ultrix42_mips.h to ultrix42mips.h so
   the filename is 14 characters.

6) printf() and sprintf() can now have more arguments than 
conversions in the format string.  This allows a "poor man's" varargs
functionality for user functions that do output.

7) new configurations:

      next, sgi, aix

8) removed HAVE_PRINTF_HD define as too obscure to be useful.

9) added missing config/apollo.h file.
