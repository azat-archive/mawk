The port of mawk to the Mac is the work of an anonymous
reviewer for comp.sources.reviewed.

The parse.c and parse.h provided in the distribution won't
work because the data exceeds 32K, so you need to obtain 
a copy of bison1.14 which is easy because the source is
free software from the FSF GNU project.  (Anonymous ftp
from prep.ai.mit.edu or any of the numerous archives that
have GNU software).

The changes needed to use bison are documented in the
Makefile.

system() and pipes are missing from MacMAWK.


added 9/30/91:

  This port is currently untested because I removed the 
  reviewer's method of modifying byacc output, because if
  bison works it will be simplier, and he is currently unable
  to test it.

  The reviewer's system:

     Macintosh SE/30 System 6.0.7
     Lightspeed Think C, version 4.0
