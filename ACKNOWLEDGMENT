Carl Mascott ported mawk to V7 and in the process rooted out
some subtle (and not so subtle) bugs.

Ian Searle ported mawk to System V and put up with my insane
attempts to get fpe exception trapping off.

An anonymous reviewer for comp.sources.reviewed did the
MSC and Mac ports and wrote .bat files for the tests.
(Everything in msdos/dostest is his/her work).
Another or maybe the same reviewer did the Dynix port.

Layne Lommen ported mawk to the ApolloSR10.3.
