Mawk is an implementation of the AWK Programming Language
as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK 
Programming Language, Addison-Wesley, 1988.

The source code is original work, in the sense that its
development relied only on the specification of the AWK
language in the book above.  Most of the algorithms and
data structures used in this code are not original --
but based on knowledge acquired from numerous sources.
Originality is claimed only for the aggregate work.  Any
ideas or techniques in this code can be freely copied and
used in other work.  

The source code may be modified provided the copyright
notices remain intact, and modifications are unambiguously
distinct from the original.  I want to retain credit for my
work and do not want credit for yours.

Redistribution in any form is permitted provided the built-in
variable VERSION is retained, and its initial value only
modified by appending extra lines.

    For example, if you modify a mawk with VERSION

	mawk x.xx Mon Year, Copyright (C) Michael D. Brennan

    then add an extra line to VERSION without modifying the
    first line.

	mawk x.xx Mon Year, Copyright (C) Michael D. Brennan
	mod y.yy  Mon Year, your name
