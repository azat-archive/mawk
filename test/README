Some benchmarks of Mawk and other (new) awks are in the file
benchmarks.

Most of the programs are one liners, but a few are interesting
and duplicated in examples directory.

To run these tests or others yourself, use the
shell script test.sh

----------------------------------------------------

One area mawk needs to improve is array[expr] access when
expr is numeric (see primes and qsort).
Mawk always converts numeric expressions to string for
array access which leads to a lot of redundant conversions.
Better array access will be added for release 1.0.

-------------------------------------------

run wfrq0.awk or words0.awk to see how much RS as a 
regular expression can speed up some programs
